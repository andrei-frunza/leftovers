This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

Leftovers is a website that works with a recipe API (EDAMAM) to look for recipes that contain ingredients entered by the user in a chip list. The local database tab was used for preliminary testing with a local MongoDB database. 

The App was created using Angular Material.
